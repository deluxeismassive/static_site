      <p>My name is Nathan Edlen and I am a fledgling web developer.   I was born in the Midwest in the city of Rockford IL but am now a proud Coloradan and hope to be for a great while. This is Riley, my loyal and sometimes very naughty pitbull mix. </p>

      <p>The last two years have been a whirlwind for me as I’ve moved from Chicago to Denver, asked my girlfriend to marry me, married said girlfriend (wife) and am expecting my first child in February!  Not to mention that I’ve made the decision to pivot professionally using the fine resources of Galvanize.  It’s been a wild ride that I wouldn’t change in any way.</p>

      <p>I’ve always been a computer guy.  My dad is a computer programmer so we always had the latest and nicest items in regards to hardware.  He taught me a few things when I was very young which had a lasting impact resonating to today.  I’ve always built my own towers and had a hobbyist’s affinity for how the inner workings of the software end. I love to game as well.  I’m a sucker for a great puzzle game a la the Myst universe or most recently <i>The Witness.</i></p>

      <p>Familywise, I have three brothers and a sister all of whom still live in the Rockford area.  They’re a diverse bunch ranging from stage-actor/design-coordinator to carpenter to big-rig driver.  We’re all very close but I don’t get to see them as much as I’d like. That's me on my gradfathers knee lower left.  We went cross country in a winebago in 1985.  It was a great trip!</p>

      <p>My parents are the best.  Even though they divorced years ago, they remain ever supportive of anything I’ve ever wanted to do.  My mom was recently diagnosed with late-stage brain cancer as of April ’16.   She’s in great spirits and the treatments seem to be working for now.  She’s incredibly excited to see her first grand-child and I hope upon hope that she’s here to see him for a long time yet. Thats me in a nutshell!</p>
