      <p>The future for me in regards to web and software development is a work in progress.  I don’t know enough to have a measured decision towards where I would fit best.  I DO know however, that I love the nature of coding.  To be able to solve logic puzzles in a creative capacity sounds like a perfect fit for my abilities.</p>

      <p>If I could, in my idealized perfect world, have any job at all I would love to be part of a team developing games.  Small or large scale wouldn’t matter, as long as I’m in the process of both developing and coding rules for games on any platform.  </p>
